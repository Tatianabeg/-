Next was Labor, which received $392,354, and last was the Nationals, which received $59,991.The Greens were not included as the party has a policy of refusing donations from fossil fuel companies and received none.By far the biggest donor was Woodside Energy, which announced last year it was pushing ahead with its $16bn project to open up the Scarborough gas field, and gave $124,000 to the Coalition and $108,350 to Labor, making for a total of $232,250.The next biggest donors were the Minerals Council of Australia, which gave $193,943 ($101,192 to the Liberals, $28,091 to the Nationals and $64,660 to Labor), and the trust for \\u201ccoal baron\\u201d Trevor St Baker, which donated $165,202. Of this, $112,758 went to the Liberal party and $52,444 to Labor.In many cases, the amounts donated skewed towards the Liberal party with groups like the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) giving the Liberal party $72,610 compared to $31,650 for Labor.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningOther companies with controversial gas developments were also spending big.Santos, which is pursuing the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project, donated $44,000 to the Labor party but nothing to the Liberals. Meanwhile, Empire Energy Group, a gas company with strong links to the Coalition that is working to frack the Beetaloo Basin, gave $40,000 to the Liberal party and $25,000 to Labor.Shani Tager, the senior campaign manager at 350, said it was clear fossil fuel companies attempting to develop projects facing significant community opposition were attempting to buy political support.Anthony Pratt gave Liberals $1.3m while upstart political groups gain sizeable donationsRead more\\u201cIt\\u2019s companies that have high-profile projects that have a really strong pushback against them that are making these donations to shore up political support,\\u201d Tager said.With \\u201cmore money than ever\\u201d being donated by fossil fuel companies, Tager said political donations from the oil and gas sector should be banned over the risk it may influence policymaking in a way that stops action on climate change.\\u201cThe Morrison government has been really, vocally supportive of the gas industry and in addition to being supportive, they have really put their money where their mouth is, they give money to these groups,\\u201d Taber said.\\u201cThis money is buying what these companies want, and that is more subsidies and special conditions for their projects going ahead.\\u201dThe federal minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, and the Labor shadow ministers, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen, were contacted for comment.Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.\",\n          \"Countries should impose windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies and divert the money to vulnerable nations suffering worsening losses from the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has urged.Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres said that \\u201cpolluters must pay\\u201d for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts, and demanded that it was \\u201chigh time to put fossil fuel producers, investors and enablers on notice\\u201d.\\u201cToday, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,\\u201d Guterres said in a speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday. \\u201cThose funds should be redirected in two ways \\u2013 to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\\u201dGuterres\\u2019s appeal came in his most urgent, and bleakest, speech to date on the state of the planet, and the will of governments to change course.His first words were: \\u201cOur world is in big trouble.\\u201d\\u201cLet\\u2019s have no illusions. We are in rough seas. A winter of global discontent is on the horizon, a cost-of-living crisis is raging, trust is crumbling, inequalities are exploding and our planet is burning,\\u201d he told the assembly. \\u201cWe have a duty to act and yet we are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction. The international community is not ready or willing to tackle the big dramatic challenges of our age.\\u201dThe lacerating speech, delivered at the UN headquarters in New York, echoes calls from activists, and the European Union, to tax major oil and gas firms currently enjoying record profits in the wake of Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In July, Exxon announced it had made a record quarterly profit of $17.8bn, while Chevron unveiled its own three-month record profit, of $11.6bn. BP, meanwhile, made a $8.5bn profit in the same period.Under Guterres\\u2019s proposal, revenue from the taxes would flow to predominantly developing countries suffering \\u201closs and damage\\u201d from global heating, to be invested in early warning systems, mopping up from disasters and other initiatives to build resilience. Vulnerable countries are poised to leverage the UN general assembly week to ask rich nations for a \\u201cclimate-related and justice-based\\u201d global tax to pay for loss and damage.Guterres has previously accused governments of having an \\u201caddiction\\u201d to fossil fuels and has called new investments in oil, coal and gas \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d.But his speech on Tuesday was particularly pointed, delivered on the grand dais of the general assembly and following the secretary general\\u2019s recent visit to Pakistan, where floods from what he called \\u201ca monsoon on steroids\\u201d have submerged a third of the country and displaced millions of people.\\u201cOur planet is burning,\\u201d Guterres said, calling on world leaders to to end their \\u201csuicidal war against nature\\u201d.\\u201cThe climate crisis is the defining issue of our time,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt must be the first priority of every government and multilateral organization. And yet climate action is being put on the back burner \\u2013 despite overwhelming public support around the world.\\u201d\\u201cWe have a rendezvous with climate disaster \\u2026 The hottest summers of today may be the coolest summers of tomorrow. Once-in-a-lifetime climate shocks may soon become once-a-year events. And with every climate disaster, we know that women and girls are the most affected. The climate crisis is a case study in moral and economic injustice.\\u201dGovernments must stage an \\u201cintervention\\u201d to break their addiction to fossil fuels, Guterres said, by targeting not only the extractive companies themselves but the entire infrastructure of businesses that support them.\\u201cThat includes the banks, private equity, asset managers and other financial institutions that continue to invest and underwrite carbon pollution,\\u201d said the secretary general.\\u201cAnd it includes the massive public relations machine raking in billions to shield the fossil fuel industry from scrutiny. Just as they did for the tobacco industry decades before, lobbyists and spin doctors have spewed harmful misinformation. Fossil fuel interests need to spend less time averting a PR disaster \\u2013 and more time averting a planetary one.\\u201dGuterres said it was \\u201chigh time to move beyond endless discussions\\u201d and deliver finance for vulnerable countries and for wealthy nations to double adaption funding by 2025, as they promised to do at UN climate talks in Scotland last year. A further round of talks, known as Cop27, will take place in Egypt in November, in which loss and damage is set to be a central issue.Although governments have agreed to restrain global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial times, almost all countries are lagging in their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to avoid this level of heating and therefore avert catastrophic climate impacts.Emissions have already rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and an analysis this week showed there are plenty of known fossil fuel reserves in the world still left to burn \\u2013 enough to unleash 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gases, which would smash the carbon budget before we get to 1.5C seven times over.\",\n          \"Running the entire width of one floor at London\\u2019s Hayward gallery is a six-screen video which depicts, at about life size, a spruce tree swaying in the breeze in Finland. To accommodate its scale, the tree is projected horizontally, and at its foot stands the artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila, in a blue parka, dwarfed by the spreading conifer. The six projected sections of the tree tremble and sway out of sync with one another, adding to a growing sense of majestic befuddlement. You can\\u2019t take it in all at once, any more than you could if you stood before the real thing. Distantly, I hear the branches soughing and faint birdsong. Titled Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora, it makes you look and look some more.Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora is one of the highlights of Among the Trees, an exhibition that fills the Hayward with a knotty tangle of romanticism, wood carving and trunk splitting, fake trees and real trees, doomed trees and casts of trees, dead trees, trees that never lived and trees that have survived for thousands of years. Pascale Marthine Tayou\\u2019s tree bears a blossom of colourful plastic bags which rustle in the draft from the gallery\\u2019s air conditioning, while Simryn Gill\\u2019s photographs of mangroves in the Straits of Malacca focus on the plastic detritus, lost fishing gear and clothing that festoon the branches in a horrible bunting on the edge of one of the world\\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.A blossom of bags \\u2026 Pascale Marthine Tayou\\u2019s Plastic Tree B. Photograph: Oak Taylor-Smith/Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThere are images of trees growing in vacant lots, of trees left standing alone as the habitat around them has been replaced by car parks, front yards and tended lawns, in a series of photographs by Robert Adams; a tree as pale and angular and bleached as the concrete wall behind it and the sky above in a painting by Gillian Carnegie; Zoe Leonard\\u2019s photographs of beleaguered New York trees growing around and through the fences and palings that contain them. All these trees, surviving against the odds.Pink blossom erupts from a straggly one before a fenced-off wasteland on a dank roadside, evoking perfectly what passes for nature in the weary edge-of-town feral hinterlands that George Shaw is so great at evoking. He captures the sense of futility and frittered time in territories marked by a blaze on a trunk, beer cans among the trodden-down leaf litter. Shaw paints the sort of non-places where people can find their pleasures or get up to no good on the margins of things. As ever, there\\u2019s no one about in his paintings, which adds to their sense of malaise. Apart from Ahtila beneath her giant spruce, there is no visible human presence in Among the Trees. But we are there, nonetheless, both as witnesses and inexorably fucking everything up. Here\\u2019s a lynching tree, photographed by Steve McQueen during the shoot for 12 Years a Slave, glowing in a lightbox. It is just a tree, venerable, old, tainted.Abel Rodr\\u00edgues and his son Wilson, from the Colombian Nonuya indigenous group, make beautiful coloured drawings evoking the Amazon forest and their knowledge of its flora and fauna, which they left for Bogot\\u00e1 in 2002. Here is one moment in the show where a sense of nature\\u2019s passing, the interconnectedness of its living landscapes, is seen with such directness and evident, deep knowledge, that it touches the heart.Among the Trees is a forest of signs. Even the gallery\\u2019s beautifully brutalist concrete walls bear the whorls and grain of the wood that was used to shutter and cast its sections. Perhaps this last provided the unconscious inspiration behind this often pleasurable and finally frustrating show of downed trunks, trees sliced into sections and reassembled, photographs of trees inverted (as though seen in a camera obscura) by Vancouver artist Rodney Graham, trees buried upside down by Robert Smithson, delicate watercolours of trees and trees only visible from certain angles, a tree carved from a log (one of several works by Giuseppe Penone), and a dense patch of forest cut by Eva Jospin from layers of corrugated cardboard. Amid this wintry tangle of trunks, branches and twigs, remnants of overgrown ruins peek from the gloom. Jospin\\u2019s work has the scale, and something of the majesty, of an arboreal rood screen. Nearby, another tangle of branches obscures Peter Doig\\u2019s 1991 The Architects Home in the Ravine, the house half hidden through frosted twigs. The quantity of accumulated details, painted touches and blips and the wandering skein of lines suck you in. I feel like a stalker in the woods, making my silent approach as I prepare a home invasion.Evoking the Amazon \\u2026 Terraza Alta II by Abel Rodr\\u00edguez. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThe theatrical atmosphere in the Hayward\\u2019s first, double-height lower gallery is accentuated by having all the works spotlit in the semi-gloom. I am not sure this entirely works for the paintings and photographs here. Thomas Struth\\u2019s mossy rocks and fallen branches below spring foliage in Japan, and his overgrown, primeval Chinese woodland \\u2013 with, disconcertingly, cable cars floating overhead \\u2013 have enough mystery and specific, well-captured light on their own.What a puzzling exhibition Among the Trees is. Given how immediate the climate emergency is, and how little explicitly records the vast losses that both environmental changes and human greed/stupidity continue to wreak on the natural world \\u2013 which is the sole thing that might save us \\u2013 will we be left with only 3D printed trees and virtual forests? Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye is another wall-length projection, filled with a grove of animated birch trees. A breeze ruffles the branches, leaves sprout, catkins grow and fall, the foliage slowly changes colour and drops in an autumn wind. The seamless cycle, a whole year compressed into three minutes, begins again.A year in three minutes \\u2026 Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye.

Sadly this won\\u2019t do. It just feels like an arty revelling in destruction. I think of the novelty two-bar electric fire my parents had - in an antique-effect aluminium grate several Disney-ish fibreglass logs glowed, fitfully, from the orange lightbulbs and twirling pinwheels that hid beneath the grey and brown loglettes, affecting a thoroughly implausible simulacrum of the real log fire that had previously sputtered and crackled in the same fireplace. The exposed electric elements did more than destroy the illusion; heating the fibreglass, they caused it to emit a noxious tang of polyester resin. Perhaps a real fire might have been even more ecologically unfriendly, but I doubt it. Among the Trees is at the Hayward gallery, London from 4 March to 17 May.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2023-01-03\",\n          \"2019-05-11\",\n          \"2023-05-28\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.\\u201cUnleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn\\u2019t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,\\u201d he said.\\u201cNew oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.\\u201dHe said the UK\\u2019s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: \\u201cIf Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.\\u201dTruss\\u2019s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government\\u2019s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.\",\n          \"The US accounts for more than a third of the expansion of global oil and gas production planned by mid-century, despite its claims of climate leadership, research has found.Canada and Russia have the next biggest expansion plans, calculated based on how much carbon dioxide is likely to be produced from new developments, followed by Iran, China and Brazil. The United Arab Emirates, which is to host the annual UN climate summit this year, Cop28 in Dubai in November, is seventh on the list.The data, in a report from the campaign group Oil Change International, also showed that five \\u201cglobal north countries\\u201d \\u2013 the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK \\u2013 will be responsible for just over half of all the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields to 2050.Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the oil and gas expansion that is planned in the next three decades would be more than enough to drive global temperatures well beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that countries agreed in 2021 at Cop26 in Glasgow, the report found.The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration and development could take place if the world was to stay within the 1.5C limit. But only a handful of countries with oil and gas reserves are forswearing new exploration and drilling.Romain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International and co-author of the report, said countries must call a halt to fossil fuel expansion. \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple: when you are in a hole, the first step is to stop digging,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe climate crisis is global in nature, but is atrociously unjust. A handful of the world\\u2019s richest nations are risking our future by willingly ignoring the calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.\\u201dThe report, titled Planet wreckers: how 20 countries\\u2019 oil and gas extraction plans risk locking in climate chaos, published on Tuesday, found that 20 countries were responsible for plans for new oil and gas developments by 2050 that would add about 173bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That amount is the same as the lifetime emissions of 1,100 coal-fired power plants, or more than 30 years of the US\\u2019s annual emissions.By contrast, if countries were to forego bringing new oil and gas fields into production, the decline of existing fields would mean global oil and gas production would slow by about 2% a year from now to 2030, and 5% a year from 2030 to 2050.The UN secretary general, Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, has stepped up calls for countries to get out of fossil fuels, warning of \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d, and has said fossil fuel interests have \\u201chumanity by the throat\\u201d. He will convene a conference of world leaders later this month in New York to try to elicit fresh commitments to tackle the climate crisis.He has told world leaders they will be allowed to participate in the summit, on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly, only if they can show that they have clear implementation plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian revealed at the weekend that Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, had been warned of the UN\\u2019s strict policy on whether leaders could participate before he took the highly unusual decision not to attend the UN general assembly.Sunak promised over the summer to \\u201cmax out\\u201d the UK\\u2019s oil and gas operations in the North Sea, with scores of potential new licences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We know we cannot keep opening up new oil and gas fields if we want a habitable world, yet that is exactly what this government is doing.\\u201dShe added: \\u201cRishi Sunak needs to stop bowing to the demands of the fossil fuel companies, who continue to rake in obscene profits while millions of us cannot afford to heat our homes.\\u201dA spokesperson for the UK\\u2019s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \\u201cThis report ignores the great strides we have taken in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2021, we cut emissions by 48% while growing our economy by 65% \\u2013 decarbonising faster than any other G7 country.\\u201cEven in 2050, when we have reached net zero, it is estimated the UK may still be using a quarter of the gas we do now and, as well as strengthening our energy security, independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports.\\u201d\",\n          \"For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak\\u2019s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford\\u2019s Myles Allen and Edinburgh\\u2019s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway\\u2019s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark\\u2019s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak\\u2019s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling \\u2018entirely consistent\\u2019 with net zero plan \\u2013 UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak\\u2019s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly \\u201cunachievable\\u201d and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone \\u2013 producers and consumers \\u2013 would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.\\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-08-30\",\n          \"2022-04-05\",\n          \"2022-11-07\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.\\u201cUnleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn\\u2019t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,\\u201d he said.\\u201cNew oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.\\u201dHe said the UK\\u2019s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: \\u201cIf Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.\\u201dTruss\\u2019s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government\\u2019s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.\",\n          \"The US accounts for more than a third of the expansion of global oil and gas production planned by mid-century, despite its claims of climate leadership, research has found.Canada and Russia have the next biggest expansion plans, calculated based on how much carbon dioxide is likely to be produced from new developments, followed by Iran, China and Brazil. The United Arab Emirates, which is to host the annual UN climate summit this year, Cop28 in Dubai in November, is seventh on the list.The data, in a report from the campaign group Oil Change International, also showed that five \\u201cglobal north countries\\u201d \\u2013 the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK \\u2013 will be responsible for just over half of all the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields to 2050.Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the oil and gas expansion that is planned in the next three decades would be more than enough to drive global temperatures well beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that countries agreed in 2021 at Cop26 in Glasgow, the report found.The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration and development could take place if the world was to stay within the 1.5C limit. But only a handful of countries with oil and gas reserves are forswearing new exploration and drilling.Romain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International and co-author of the report, said countries must call a halt to fossil fuel expansion. \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple: when you are in a hole, the first step is to stop digging,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe climate crisis is global in nature, but is atrociously unjust. A handful of the world\\u2019s richest nations are risking our future by willingly ignoring the calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.\\u201dThe report, titled Planet wreckers: how 20 countries\\u2019 oil and gas extraction plans risk locking in climate chaos, published on Tuesday, found that 20 countries were responsible for plans for new oil and gas developments by 2050 that would add about 173bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That amount is the same as the lifetime emissions of 1,100 coal-fired power plants, or more than 30 years of the US\\u2019s annual emissions.By contrast, if countries were to forego bringing new oil and gas fields into production, the decline of existing fields would mean global oil and gas production would slow by about 2% a year from now to 2030, and 5% a year from 2030 to 2050.The UN secretary general, Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, has stepped up calls for countries to get out of fossil fuels, warning of \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d, and has said fossil fuel interests have \\u201chumanity by the throat\\u201d. He will convene a conference of world leaders later this month in New York to try to elicit fresh commitments to tackle the climate crisis.He has told world leaders they will be allowed to participate in the summit, on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly, only if they can show that they have clear implementation plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian revealed at the weekend that Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, had been warned of the UN\\u2019s strict policy on whether leaders could participate before he took the highly unusual decision not to attend the UN general assembly.Sunak promised over the summer to \\u201cmax out\\u201d the UK\\u2019s oil and gas operations in the North Sea, with scores of potential new licences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We know we cannot keep opening up new oil and gas fields if we want a habitable world, yet that is exactly what this government is doing.\\u201dShe added: \\u201cRishi Sunak needs to stop bowing to the demands of the fossil fuel companies, who continue to rake in obscene profits while millions of us cannot afford to heat our homes.\\u201dA spokesperson for the UK\\u2019s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \\u201cThis report ignores the great strides we have taken in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2021, we cut emissions by 48% while growing our economy by 65% \\u2013 decarbonising faster than any other G7 country.\\u201cEven in 2050, when we have reached net zero, it is estimated the UK may still be using a quarter of the gas we do now and, as well as strengthening our energy security, independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports.\\u201d\",\n          \"For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak\\u2019s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford\\u2019s Myles Allen and Edinburgh\\u2019s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway\\u2019s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark\\u2019s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak\\u2019s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling \\u2018entirely consistent\\u2019 with net zero plan \\u2013 UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak\\u2019s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly \\u201cunachievable\\u201d and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone \\u2013 producers and consumers \\u2013 would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.\\r\\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist\\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Joanna Partridge']\",\n          \"['Archie Bland']\",\n          \"['Rob Davies', '@ByRobDavies']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-08-30\",\n          \"2022-04-05\",\n          \"2022-11-07\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Intro Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tory leadership candidate criticised by campaigners after reports her team have met energy firms\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitics live \\u2013 latest updates\\r\\n\",\n          \"Study highlights conflict between Washington\\u2019s claims of climate leadership and its fossil fuel growth plans\",\n          \"Consensus on tackling the climate crisis is what\\u2019s needed now \\u2013 and direct action against CO2 must be the next move\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Liz Truss \\u2018will approve more oil drilling if she becomes PM\\u2019\",\n          \" This article is more than 4 months oldUS behind more than a third of global oil and gas expansion plans, report findsThis article is more than 4 months old\",\n          \" This article is more than 5 months oldSunak\\u2019s plan for carbon capture is good news: he shouldn\\u2019t muddy it with party politicsThis article is more than 5 months oldSimon Jenkins\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"annotation_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          18,\n          16\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"annotator\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_at\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-02-23T14:35:01.566018Z\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": 2,\n        \"max\": 21,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lead_time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9.474774305185877,\n        \"min\": 1.757,\n        \"max\": 44.35,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.051\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"updated_at\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-02-23T14:35:04.301517Z\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.\\u201cUnleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn\\u2019t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,\\u201d he said.\\u201cNew oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.\\u201dHe said the UK\\u2019s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: \\u201cIf Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.\\u201dTruss\\u2019s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government\\u2019s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.\",\n          \"The US accounts for more than a third of the expansion of global oil and gas production planned by mid-century, despite its claims of climate leadership, research has found.Canada and Russia have the next biggest expansion plans, calculated based on how much carbon dioxide is likely to be produced from new developments, followed by Iran, China and Brazil. The United Arab Emirates, which is to host the annual UN climate summit this year, Cop28 in Dubai in November, is seventh on the list.The data, in a report from the campaign group Oil Change International, also showed that five \\u201cglobal north countries\\u201d \\u2013 the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK \\u2013 will be responsible for just over half of all the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields to 2050.Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the oil and gas expansion that is planned in the next three decades would be more than enough to drive global temperatures well beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that countries agreed in 2021 at Cop26 in Glasgow, the report found.The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration and development could take place if the world was to stay within the 1.5C limit. But only a handful of countries with oil and gas reserves are forswearing new exploration and drilling.Romain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International and co-author of the report, said countries must call a halt to fossil fuel expansion. \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple: when you are in a hole, the first step is to stop digging,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe climate crisis is global in nature, but is atrociously unjust. A handful of the world\\u2019s richest nations are risking our future by willingly ignoring the calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.\\u201dThe report, titled Planet wreckers: how 20 countries\\u2019 oil and gas extraction plans risk locking in climate chaos, published on Tuesday, found that 20 countries were responsible for plans for new oil and gas developments by 2050 that would add about 173bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That amount is the same as the lifetime emissions of 1,100 coal-fired power plants, or more than 30 years of the US\\u2019s annual emissions.By contrast, if countries were to forego bringing new oil and gas fields into production, the decline of existing fields would mean global oil and gas production would slow by about 2% a year from now to 2030, and 5% a year from 2030 to 2050.The UN secretary general, Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, has stepped up calls for countries to get out of fossil fuels, warning of \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d, and has said fossil fuel interests have \\u201chumanity by the throat\\u201d. He will convene a conference of world leaders later this month in New York to try to elicit fresh commitments to tackle the climate crisis.He has told world leaders they will be allowed to participate in the summit, on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly, only if they can show that they have clear implementation plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian revealed at the weekend that Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, had been warned of the UN\\u2019s strict policy on whether leaders could participate before he took the highly unusual decision not to attend the UN general assembly.Sunak promised over the summer to \\u201cmax out\\u201d the UK\\u2019s oil and gas operations in the North Sea, with scores of potential new licences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We know we cannot keep opening up new oil and gas fields if we want a habitable world, yet that is exactly what this government is doing.\\u201dShe added: \\u201cRishi Sunak needs to stop bowing to the demands of the fossil fuel companies, who continue to rake in obscene profits while millions of us cannot afford to heat our homes.\\u201dA spokesperson for the UK\\u2019s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \\u201cThis report ignores the great strides we have taken in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2021, we cut emissions by 48% while growing our economy by 65% \\u2013 decarbonising faster than any other G7 country.\\u201cEven in 2050, when we have reached net zero, it is estimated the UK may still be using a quarter of the gas we do now and, as well as strengthening our energy security, independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports.\\u201d\",\n          \"For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak\\u2019s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford\\u2019s Myles Allen and Edinburgh\\u2019s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway\\u2019s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark\\u2019s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak\\u2019s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling \\u2018entirely consistent\\u2019 with net zero plan \\u2013 UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak\\u2019s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly \\u201cunachievable\\u201d and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone \\u2013 producers and consumers \\u2013 would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.\\r\\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist\\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Joanna Partridge']\",\n          \"['Archie Bland']\",\n          \"['Rob Davies', '@ByRobDavies']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-08-30\",\n          \"2022-04-05\",\n          \"2022-11-07\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Intro Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tory leadership candidate criticised by campaigners after reports her team have met energy firms\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitics live \\u2013 latest updates\\r\\n\",\n          \"Study highlights conflict between Washington\\u2019s claims of climate leadership and its fossil fuel growth plans\",\n          \"Consensus on tackling the climate crisis is what\\u2019s needed now \\u2013 and direct action against CO2 must be the next move\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Liz Truss \\u2018will approve more oil drilling if she becomes PM\\u2019\",\n          \" This article is more than 4 months oldUS behind more than a third of global oil and gas expansion plans, report findsThis article is more than 4 months old\",\n          \" This article is more than 5 months oldSunak\\u2019s plan for carbon capture is good news: he shouldn\\u2019t muddy it with party politicsThis article is more than 5 months oldSimon Jenkins\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He played rugby, with more enthusiasm than talent; and, in spite of being Jewish, took pride in reading the lesson in chapel: this gave him an inkling that there might be something true in religion. This conviction developed into an active involvement in the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, now known as the Movement for Reform Judaism, first in the 1960s as a member of the newly formed Finchley Reform Synagogue in London, and later as chair (1996-99) of the national movement.Born in Cricklewood, north-west London, Neville was brought up by relatives following the hospitalisation of his mother, Rachel (nee Proops), who died when he was five. He remained close to his father, Sam, an accountant, who sent his son, after the disruption of the second world war years, to Haileybury, where he became head boy.He entered the same accountancy firm as his father, who died suddenly when Neville was 22, and remained at Barnes Roffe for the whole of his career, eventually becoming an innovative senior partner. Marriage to Margaret Cohen in 1958, and their devoted raising of three daughters, was combined with his professional life.Meanwhile, his interest in personal development led him to become involved in neurolinguistic programming and the Landmark Forum, an organisation offering training in personal and professional growth. But it was his encounter in 1974 with the spiritual exercises of Subud, an international spiritual community inspired by Islamic mysticism, that became pivotal to his growing awareness that personal spirituality and collective social and environmental transformation went hand in hand.A conversation with Rabbi Lionel Blue, and a close working relationship with his synagogue\\u2019s rabbi, Jeffrey Newman, supported his conviction that a divine energy (what people call God) was available for individuals and groups and that contact with this force could lead to remarkable changes.He was insistent, when talking to me, a friend and rabbi, that liturgical creativity was vital in helping Jews develop their own relationship with God and that spiritual work and political activism were indivisible.Active in the Jewish Board of Deputies, he fought an often lonely battle to raise awareness in the Jewish community of the moral imperative to take the environmental crisis seriously. It was only when he was able to involve David Miliband (then secretary of state for the environment) in the launch in 2007 of the Big Green Jewish Website, that change in the community\\u2019s awareness began to gather pace.Neville is survived by Margaret, and their daughters, Jo, Jane and Gill, and grandchildren, Ellie and Jess.\",\n          \"Throughout autumn, I tiptoed down my path into the sprawling, dew-heavy garden to pick the last of the seeds. I\\u2019d do this before breakfast, taking back whatever treasure I found to the kitchen to dry off as I drank my coffee.Starting the day collecting seeds was meditative and calming while the news on the radio whirled on. Never have I collected seeds like I have this year: Tupperware containers, old face cream pots, brown envelopes and tins that once held mints filled up with them. I sent seeds to everyone and anyone, and pressed little packages into the hands of visitors as they left the house.Most of our commercial seed is in the hands of a few global companies, and it is not news that the diversity of seed, particularly of vegetables and grains, has drastically reduced in the past hundred years, in part because of this. It is calculated that we\\u2019ve lost about 90% of crop varieties.Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine\\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.Big companies do not support diversity. And yet that is exactly what we need. Who knows what the perfect squash might be in 100 years\\u2019 time? The only way we can ensure future gardeners have a wider library of genes to draw on is to do it ourselves.Every time you grow something, it adapts a little to your part of the world, and this is preserved if you save some seedThankfully, seed saving is deep within our DNA and people have been squirrelling away seeds for as long as we\\u2019ve tended the earth. And you, even if you don\\u2019t know it yet, have the potential to create diversity that the seed companies can\\u2019t. This is because crops are always evolving with the world around them, with their soils, their pests and disease, with the wind and the sun and the rain. Every time you grow something it adapts, just a little, to your corner of the world, but these adaptations are maintained only if you save some of their seed.Just saving seeds isn\\u2019t quite enough, though; it needs to be done well. This means growing the best plants we can in the healthiest soil; preventing unwanted cross-pollination; and selecting specimens for the most appropriate traits, so that varieties remain true to type and work for our location. It requires a nuanced understanding of growing, harvesting, processing, drying and storing.So here\\u2019s a gift idea for the gardener in your life \\u2013 knowledge. For \\u00a348, Vital Seeds\\u2019 online seed-saving course is a brilliant starting point that covers the basics. The Gaia Foundation\\u2019s seed sovereignty programmes also have free resources for gardeners, including free webinars and films on seed production.Seed saving is more than just growing; it is about our past and our future, about all the diversity we\\u2019ve inherited from those before us and what we choose to send into the future.\",\n          \"KESWICK: The last noticeable population influx to settle in the north-west was, perhaps, that of the German miners in the 16th century. But if you look at country faces there is much else to see. Anyone who has seen the dead, gaunt face of Tollund man raised from his Danish bog can still see his counterpart here along with round-headed Celts, fair Scandinavians and others. The dialect, too, is an amalgam of peoples \\u2013 for isolation, difficult country and even the Border wars have served to keep the farther north-west different. That is all changing \\u2013 mobility alters many things \\u2013 but one of the saddest things is the quiet desperation of the work-a-day young in the country places who cannot compete with the incoming wealth and are forced to leave their place of birth and seek cheaper housing elsewhere. Almost any village you like to mention suffers this way. Time was when if you kicked someone at one end of the village you hurt someone else, blood-tied, at the other, and family likeness \\u201cstamped on every link\\u201d was easy to see.Second homes are a gross injustice, yet the UK government encourages them | George MonbiotRead moreMaterial things change too. How much longer will there be dry stone walls or well-layered hedges, and who will be able (or can afford) to build stone barns? Too many barns are already \\u201cresidences\\u201d for the better-off. This is not a lament for time past. That would be too easy. But it is a plea to look at what matters before it is too late.
